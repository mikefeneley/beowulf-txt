Beowulf text adventure game

<b>Roadmap</b>

I want to write a simple text adventure game based on the book Beowulf and norse mythology. I want it to run similar to the old interactive fiction games like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy where the player types in commands to play and has to solve puzzles while exploring the world. I think it will be a fun exercise in creativity vs technical skills.
